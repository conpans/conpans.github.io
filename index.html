            : This involved setting up a home lab to explore Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) using the Elastic Stack with a Kali Linux virtual machine (VM). The setup included configuring an Elastic Agent on Kali to forward security events to the Elastic SIEM, generating various security events using tools like Nmap, and analyzing the events through dashboards and alerts to gain hands-on experience in security monitoring and incident response.
