    <h1>Automated Threat Detection and Response Lab</h1>

    <p>This page highlights my home cybersecurity lab environment set up using VMware Workstation Pro, along with both Windows and Ubuntu virtual machines (VMs). It provides a detailed overview of the entire setup process, including downloading and installing the required software, configuring the VMs, and deploying essential tools for security testing and analysis.</p>

    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This lab focuses on enhancing cybersecurity defenses through the use of tools like LimaCharlie EDR, YARA, Sliver C2, and VMware Workstation Pro. I configured automated detection and response rules to identify and block malicious activities, such as ransomware attempts to delete volume shadow copies. By implementing YARA signatures, I automated malware detection for both files and processes. These improvements enhance the ability to respond quickly to threats and maintain a secure environment. The lab emphasizes the importance of continuous testing, refining detection rules, and adapting capabilities to stay ahead of emerging cyber threats.</p>

        <li>Return to the Windows VM and execute the C2 payload using the Administrative PowerShell console:</li>
        <pre><code>C:\Users\User\Downloads\[payload_name].exe</code></pre>

        <img src="exeprogc2.png" alt="LimaCharlie Installation Screenshot" class="screenshot">

        <li>Confirm that the session has successfully connected to the Sliver server:</li>
        <pre><code>sessions</code></pre>
        <li>Use the session ID to interact with the C2 session:</li>
        <pre><code>use [session_id]</code></pre>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Basic Commands for C2 Interaction</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Retrieve basic session information:</li>
        <pre><code>info</code></pre>
        <li>Check the user context and privileges of the implant:</li>
        <pre><code>
    whoami
    getprivs
        </code></pre>

        <img src="infoc2.png" alt="LimaCharlie Installation Screenshot" class="screenshot">

        <li>Determine the working directory of the implant:</li>
        <pre><code>pwd</code></pre>
        <li>Review network connections on the remote system:</li>
        <pre><code>netstat</code></pre>
        <li>Display running processes on the remote system:</li>
        <pre><code>ps -T</code></pre>
    </ul>
    
    <p>These procedures allow you to generate and deploy a C2 payload, establish a control session, and interact with the compromised Windows VM. By examining network connections and active processes, you gain valuable insights into the security status of the target system, including identifying any defensive measures in place.</p>
    
    <h2>Monitor EDR Telemetry in LimaCharlie</h2>
    <p>With the C2 payload running on the Windows VM, we will use the LimaCharlie web UI to monitor telemetry data and gain insights into the activities occurring on the endpoint. This involves exploring various aspects of LimaCharlie, such as process monitoring, network activity, and file system interactions.</p>

    <img src="processeslc.png" alt="LimaCharlie Installation Screenshot" class="screenshot">

    <h3>Examining Process Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Log in to the LimaCharlie web UI.</li>
        <li>Click on “Sensors” in the left-side menu to view a list of your active sensors.</li>
        <li>Select your active Windows sensor from the list.</li>
        <li>Click on “Processes” in the new left-side menu to see the process tree.</li>
        <li>Spend time exploring the process tree, hovering over icons for more details about each process.</li>
        <li>Identify unsigned processes, as these might be suspicious. Verify if your C2 implant is unsigned and observe its network activity.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Investigating Network Activity</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Click on the “Network” tab in the left-side menu to view network connections.</li>
        <li>Use <code>Ctrl+F</code> to search for your implant name or C2 IP address within the network list.</li>
        <li>Pay attention to any unusual or unexpected network connections, particularly those associated with your implant.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <img src="filesyslc.png" alt="LimaCharlie Installation Screenshot" class="screenshot">

    <h3>Inspecting the File System</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Go to the “File System” tab in the left-side menu.</li>
        <li>Navigate to the directory where the implant is located (e.g., <code>C:\Users\User\Downloads</code>).</li>
        <li>Check the hash of the suspicious executable using the “Scan with VirusTotal” option.</li>
        <li>Keep in mind that if VirusTotal shows “Item not found,” it does not necessarily mean the file is safe. It may indicate that the file is new or custom-made.</li>
    </ul>

    <img src="timelinelc.png" alt="EDR Telemetry Screenshot" class="screenshot">

    <h3>Utilizing the Timeline View</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Navigate to the “Timeline” tab in the left-side menu of the selected sensor.</li>
        <li>The Timeline provides a near real-time display of EDR telemetry and event logs.</li>
        <li>Use filters to locate known Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) like the implant name or C2 IP address.</li>
        <li>Scroll through the timeline to identify key events, such as when the implant was created, launched, and its subsequent network activities.</li>
        <li>Look for events such as “SENSITIVE_PROCESS_ACCESS,” which may have occurred when privileges were enumerated earlier. These events will be vital for creating detection rules later on.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By leveraging LimaCharlie’s detailed views and analysis tools, you can monitor suspicious activities and understand how attackers interact with compromised systems. Knowing the difference between normal and abnormal behaviors is crucial for effectively detecting and responding to security incidents.</p>

    <h2>Simulating Adversarial Behavior</h2>
    <p>We will simulate adversarial activities using the Sliver C2 session to perform actions commonly associated with cyber threats. This will help us learn how to detect and respond to such activities using our security tools.</p>

    <h3>Reconnect to the Sliver C2 Session</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Start an SSH session on the Linux VM and re-establish the C2 session on the Windows VM using Sliver.</li>
        <li>If needed, refer back to Part 2 to reconnect to the C2 session.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Checking Privileges</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Within the Sliver session, verify the current privileges to ensure the ability to perform privileged actions:</li>
        <pre><code>getprivs</code></pre>
        <li>Look for <code>SeDebugPrivilege</code>. If present, proceed. If not, restart your C2 implant with administrative rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <img src="procdumpls.png" alt="EDR Telemetry Screenshot" class="screenshot">

    <h3>Dumping LSASS Process for Credential Theft</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Adversaries frequently dump the LSASS process to steal credentials. Execute the following command to dump <code>lsass.exe</code>:</li>
        <pre><code>procdump -n lsass.exe -s lsass.dmp</code></pre>
        <li>This command will dump the process memory locally on the Sliver C2 server. Even if it fails, it may still generate valuable telemetry for detection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Detecting Adversarial Activity</h3>
    <p>Switch to the LimaCharlie web UI to detect the LSASS dump attempt:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Go to the “Timeline” of your Windows VM sensor in LimaCharlie.</li>
        <li>Use the “Event Type Filters” to find <code>SENSITIVE_PROCESS_ACCESS</code> events.</li>
        <li>Examine events associated with LSASS access, which are commonly linked to credential dumping techniques.</li>
    </ul>

    <img src="adverdetect.png" alt="EDR Telemetry Screenshot" class="screenshot">

    <img src="detectrule.png" alt="EDR Telemetry Screenshot" class="screenshot">

    <h3>Creating a Detection and Response (D&R) Rule</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the button to start building a detection rule based on the LSASS access event.</li>
        <li>In the “Detect” section, replace the existing content with the following:</li>
        <pre><code>
    event: SENSITIVE_PROCESS_ACCESS
    op: ends with
    path: event/*/TARGET/FILE_PATH
    value: lsass.exe
        </code></pre>
        <li>This rule will detect any access to <code>lsass.exe</code> flagged by <code>SENSITIVE_PROCESS_ACCESS</code> events.</li>
    </ul>

    <img src="rulecreation.png" alt="EDR Telemetry Screenshot" class="screenshot">

    <h3>Configuring the Response Action</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In the “Respond” section, replace the existing content with the following:</li>
        <pre><code>
    - action: report
    name: LSASS access
        </code></pre>
        <li>This basic action generates a detection report whenever the rule is triggered.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Testing and Saving the Rule</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Test the rule by selecting “Target Event” below the D&R rule.</li>
        <li>Scroll to the bottom of the raw event and click “Test Event” to validate the detection logic.</li>
        <li>A successful test will show a “Match” confirmation.</li>
        <li>Scroll back up, click “Save Rule,” name it “LSASS Accessed,” and ensure it is enabled.</li>
    </ul>

    <img src="ruletest.png" alt="EDR Telemetry Screenshot" class="screenshot">

    <p>Simulating these adversarial actions and configuring detection rules provides practical experience in identifying and responding to malicious activities. This exercise demonstrates the use of EDR telemetry and detection logic to monitor sensitive processes like LSASS for unauthorized access attempts.</p>

    <h2>Testing Detections with Repeated Adversarial Activity</h2>
    <p>We will repeat the adversarial action to validate the detection rules. By rerunning the LSASS dump, we can verify that our LimaCharlie detection setup correctly identifies this malicious activity.</p>

    <h3>Re-running the Procdump Command</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Return to the Sliver server console and reconnect to your C2 session on the Windows VM.</li>
        <li>Execute the same procdump command to attempt dumping the <code>lsass.exe</code> process again:</li>
        <pre><code>procdump -n lsass.exe -s lsass.dmp</code></pre>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reviewing Detections in LimaCharlie</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Switch back to the LimaCharlie web UI.</li>
        <li>Click on the “Detections” tab in the main left-side menu.</li>
        <li>If you are in the sensor's context, click “Back to Sensors” at the top of the menu to reveal the “Detections” option.</li>
    </ul>

    <img src="detectionruleworking.png" alt="EDR Telemetry Screenshot" class="screenshot">

    <h3>Analyzing Detection Results</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Expand a detection entry to view the associated raw event details.</li>
        <li>Click “View Event Timeline” within the detection entry to jump directly to the timeline where the event was logged.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By repeating the malicious activity and reviewing detection results, you can confirm that your custom detection rules are effectively identifying suspicious actions. This hands-on practice reinforces your understanding of using EDR tools for monitoring and protecting against real-world threats.</p>

    <p>In a production environment, it’s crucial to fine-tune detection rules to minimize noise and focus on genuine threats. Regular testing and adjustments will enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of your security monitoring strategy.</p>

    <h2>Preventing Malicious Activities</h2>

    <p>Volume Shadow Copies allow for easy restoration of files or entire file systems, making them a vital component in recovering from ransomware attacks. It’s a predictable behavior that one of the first actions of ransomware is to delete these copies to prevent recovery.</p>

    <p>The command commonly used to delete volume shadow copies is:</p>
    <pre><code>vssadmin delete shadows /all</code></pre>
    <p>This command is rarely executed in healthy environments (though some backup or software management tools might occasionally use it), making it a suitable candidate for a blocking rule with low false positives and high threat relevance.</p>

    <h3>Setting Up Detection</h3>
    <p>Start your Linux and Windows VMs and return to your Sliver C2 shell.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SSH into the Linux VM and open a C2 session on the target Windows VM.</li>
        <li>Refer back to Part 2 if you need guidance on re-establishing the session.</li>
        <li>If you face issues with the HTTP listener, consider rebooting the Ubuntu VM.</li>
        <li>In the Sliver C2 shell on the victim system, execute the command we want to detect and block:</li>
        <pre><code>shell</code></pre>

        <img src="shellc2.png" alt="EDR Telemetry Screenshot" class="screenshot">

        <li>When prompted with “This action is bad OPSEC, are you an adult?”, type Y and press Enter.</li>
        <li>In the new system shell, run:</li>
        <pre><code>vssadmin delete shadows /all</code></pre>
        <li>The output doesn’t matter; running the command is enough to generate the necessary telemetry.</li>
        <li>Run <code>whoami</code> to verify that the system shell is still active:</li>
        <pre><code>whoami</code></pre>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reviewing Detection in LimaCharlie</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Navigate to LimaCharlie’s “Detections” tab to see if default Sigma rules detected the command.</li>
        <li>Click on the detection to view the metadata and references provided by the Sigma rules, which help understand the reasoning behind the detection.</li>
        <li>Check the event in the Timeline to see the raw event that triggered the detection.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Based on the observed detection, create a D&R rule:</p>

    <img src="detecrulec2.png" alt="EDR Telemetry Screenshot" class="screenshot">

    <ul>
        <li>Start crafting a D&R rule using the offending event as a template.</li>
        <li>Add the following response actions in the “Respond” section:</li>
        <pre><code>
    - action: report
    name: vss_deletion_kill_it
    - action: task
    command:
        - deny_tree
        - &lt;&lt;routing/parent&gt;&gt;
        </code></pre>
        <li>The <code>action: report</code> generates a detection report. The <code>action: task</code> uses <code>deny_tree</code> to terminate the parent process responsible for running <code>vssadmin delete shadows /all</code>.</li>
        <li>Save your rule with the name: <code>vss_deletion_kill_it</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Testing the Blocking Rule</h3>
    <p>Return to your Sliver C2 session and rerun the command to delete volume shadows:</p>
    <pre><code>vssadmin delete shadows /all</code></pre>

    <img src="rerunvss.png" alt="EDR Telemetry Screenshot" class="screenshot">

    <ul>
        <li>The command itself may succeed, but the act of running it should trigger your D&R rule.</li>
        <li>To confirm the D&R rule worked, try running <code>whoami</code> again in the system shell:</li>
        <pre><code>whoami</code></pre>
        <li>If the rule successfully terminated the parent process, the system shell will hang or provide no output, indicating the process was killed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you see output like “Shell Exited,” it indicates the process was effectively terminated. In a real-world ransomware scenario, this could mean stopping the ransomware payload or lateral movement tool responsible for the attack.</p>

    <h2>Automating Malware Detection with YARA</h2>

    <p>This focuses on leveraging the advanced capabilities of our EDR sensor to automatically scan files and processes for malware using YARA signatures.</p>

    <h3>Setting Up Automated YARA Scans in LimaCharlie</h3>
    <p>We’ll configure our LimaCharlie instance to automatically detect certain file and process activities and trigger YARA scans.</p>

    <h3>Adding a YARA Signature for Sliver C2 Payload</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Since we’re working with the Sliver C2 payload, we can use a YARA signature tailored to detect Sliver.</li>
        <li>The UK National Cyber Security Centre has published helpful YARA signatures for Sliver. These have been extracted from the original PDF format for convenience.</li>
        <li>Navigate to “Automation” > “YARA Rules” in LimaCharlie.</li>
        <li>If you see “YARA Service” instead of “YARA Rules,” switch to the new YARA Extension.</li>
        <li>If a permission error occurs, fix it by going to “Access Management” > “Users & Roles,” selecting your username, and enabling all permissions. Then update and close.</li>
        <li>Go back to “Automation” > “YARA Rules” and click “Add YARA Rule.”</li>
        <li>Name the rule <code>sliver</code> and paste the relevant YARA signature into the rule block.</li>
        <li>Save the rule.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Setting Up Detection & Response (D&R) Rules for YARA Detections</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a D&R rule to generate alerts when YARA detects a threat not related to a process object:</li>
        <pre><code>
    event: YARA_DETECTION
    op: and
    rules:
    - not: true
        op: exists
        path: event/PROCESS/*
    - op: exists
        path: event/RULE_NAME
        </code></pre>
        <li>In the Respond block:</li>
        <pre><code>
    - action: report
    name: YARA Detection {{ .event.RULE_NAME }}
    - action: add tag
    tag: yara_detection
    ttl: 80000
        </code></pre>
        <li>Save this rule as <code>YARA Detection</code>.</li>
        <li>Create another D&R rule for YARA detections specifically involving a process:</li>
        <pre><code>
    event: YARA_DETECTION
    op: and
    rules:
    - op: exists
        path: event/RULE_NAME
    - op: exists
        path: event/PROCESS/*
        </code></pre>
        <li>In the Respond block:</li>
        <pre><code>
    - action: report
    name: YARA Detection in Memory {{ .event.RULE_NAME }}
    - action: add tag
    tag: yara_detection_memory
    ttl: 80000
        </code></pre>
        <li>Save this rule as <code>YARA Detection in Memory</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Testing the YARA Signature</h3>
    <p>We know there’s a Sliver implant in the Downloads folder on our Windows VM. Let’s manually initiate a YARA scan to verify the setup:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Go to the “Sensors List” in LimaCharlie and select your Windows VM sensor.</li>
        <li>Access the EDR Sensor Console to run commands.</li>
        <li>Execute the following command, replacing <code>[payload_name]</code> with your Sliver executable name:</li>
        <pre><code>yara_scan hive://yara/sliver -f C:\Users\User\Downloads\[payload_name].exe</code></pre>
        <li>Ensure a positive YARA detection is recorded on the “Detections” screen.</li>
    </ul>

    <img src="downloadmoveddetec.png" alt="EDR Telemetry Screenshot" class="screenshot">

    <h3>Automating YARA Scans on New Executables</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a D&R rule that scans new .exe files appearing in any user’s Downloads directory:</li>
        <pre><code>
    event: NEW_DOCUMENT
    op: and
    rules:
    - op: starts with
        path: event/FILE_PATH
        value: C:\Users\
    - op: contains
        path: event/FILE_PATH
        value: \Downloads\
    - op: ends with
        path: event/FILE_PATH
        value: .exe
        </code></pre>
        <li>In the Respond block:</li>
        <pre><code>
    - action: report
    name: EXE dropped in Downloads directory
    - action: task
    command: >-
        yara_scan hive://yara/sliver -f "{{ .event.FILE_PATH }}"
    investigation: Yara Scan Exe
    suppression:
        is_global: false
        keys:
        - '{{ .event.FILE_PATH }}'
        - Yara Scan Exe
        max_count: 1
        period: 1m
        </code></pre>
        <li>Save this rule as <code>YARA Scan Downloaded EXE</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Automating YARA Scans on Processes Launched from Downloads</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a D&R rule for processes started from a user’s Downloads directory:</li>
        <pre><code>
    event: NEW_PROCESS
    op: and
    rules:
    - op: starts with
        path: event/FILE_PATH
        value: C:\Users\
    - op: contains
        path: event/FILE_PATH
        value: \Downloads\
        </code></pre>
        <li>In the Respond block:</li>
        <pre><code>
    - action: report
    name: Execution from Downloads directory
    - action: task
    command: yara_scan hive://yara/sliver-process --pid "{{ .event.PROCESS_ID }}"
    investigation: Yara Scan Process
    suppression:
        is_global: false
        keys:
        - '{{ .event.PROCESS_ID }}'
        - Yara Scan Process
        max_count: 1
        period: 1m
        </code></pre>
        <li>Save this rule as <code>YARA Scan Process Launched from Downloads</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Triggering the New Rules</h3>

    <img src="exemoved.png" alt="EDR Telemetry Screenshot" class="screenshot">

    <p>To test our new rules, simulate a new EXE appearing in the Downloads directory by moving the Sliver payload out and back into the Downloads folder:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Use PowerShell to move the payload to Documents:</li>
        <pre><code>Move-Item -Path C:\Users\User\Downloads\[payload_name].exe -Destination C:\Users\User\Documents\[payload_name].exe</code></pre>
        <li>Move it back to Downloads:</li>
        <pre><code>Move-Item -Path C:\Users\User\Documents\[payload_name].exe -Destination C:\Users\User\Downloads\[payload_name].exe</code></pre>
        <li>Check the Detections tab for new alerts indicating a YARA scan was triggered.</li>
    </ul>
